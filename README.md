# Python-learn

This repository is a collection of programs I write with Python and example code from exercises.

Exercises and Challenges are all from Microsoft Docs and freeCodeCamp.org. Find my profiles at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/Sydney-8318 and https://www.freecodecamp.org/just_cherry_thx for the modules in full and any other progress not posted in GitHub.

I've been using Microsoft Visual Studio Code to write and test programs posted!

Thank you for taking the time to look over my work! Every time I even write the most basic program (it seems) it's SO COOL to watch it come together!
